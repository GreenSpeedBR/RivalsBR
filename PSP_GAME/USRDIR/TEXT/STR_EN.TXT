Not to worry, they're sound asleep inside these cards.
If either of you want these cards, you'll have to catch me first!
Ho ho ho ho!
Wait! Come back here!
No hard feelings, Sonic, but this time there's no way you're gonna beat me!
Okay, Knuckles... Then let's race for it! First one who gets to Eggman takes all!
Dang it... I came all the way to this island looking for the Master Emerald, but there's no sign of it here...
Something about this island feels really familiar, though...
Hey! Isn't that... Eggman!
That's it! He must be involved in this again!
Hey, Eggman!
The Master Emerald is gone... I'll bet you're behind this, aren't you?!
Heh heh heh... Yes, that's right!
The Master Emerald you're looking for is right here, locked away in this card.
Hey, Eggman![N]What have you done with Amy and Tails!?
All right, Eggman! A promise is a promise... Give me back that card!
Hmm... Well, I suppose if you win my little contest, I could give you a card of your choosing.
What!? That's not what you said before!
Fine, I'll take it by force, then!
I thought I had him, but then he disappeared into the light!?
You let the doctor get away? Hmph! You're useless...
What'd you say!?[N]What's your problem, Shadow!?
Don't mess with me, I'm not in the mood! I might take it out on you, got it?
Whatever Knuckles... But first, I've got some business with the doctor!
All righty then... Let's see who can catch him first!
You're on! Let's do it!
Doctor! What are you hiding?
Hey, Shadow![N]Mind your own business!
Yo, Eggman![N]You'd better hand over the Master Emerald this time!
Annoying pests! I'll crush you with my mechanical pets!
Bring it on! We'll see who crushes who!
How's that, Eggman?!
Dang it! Where did he go!
Well, well, it looks like you've won. Here's the card, as promised!
He certainly knows how to run, I'll give him that...
It's about time! Now hand it over!
Hey, you there! Did you see that guy carrying something strange?
What's the big hurry? Do you even know how to use the Master Emerald card?
Actually... he has this weird camera that changes things into cards... Wait a minute... Who are you?
You use it like this!
What'd you say!? How did he get a hold of it?
What!? There's that light again!
You...![N]What are you mumbling about?
Got no time to waste on you. See ya!
You little... Get back here!
This oughta be fun! Bring it on, Eggman!
Hey, Eggman!
How did you make the Master Emerald disappear from Angel Island?
Hmm... Well... You came from Angel Island, didn't you?
What you don't seem to realize is that this IS Angel Island.
What!? This is Angel Island!?
You're not making any sense, Eggman!
Heh heh heh. Do you need an explanation, then?
Very well! If you can manage to defeat my Metal Sonic, I'll tell you what you want to know.
What the...?[N]Metal Sonic?!
Hey, wait! There's no way you're gonna beat me to him!
Come to think of it, the shape of this island is similar to Angel Island...
But the real Angel Island is still there, right? So this one's got to be a fake...
Argh! I just don't get it!
Hey, isn't that Shadow over there?! He might know where Eggman is!
Hey, Shadow! Did you find Eggman?
Heh... Looks like the doctor got away from you again...
Shut up! I was this close to catching him!
Anyway, doesn't seem like you've found him either!
Maybe not, but at least I'm not as clueless as you. I'll see you later!
Doctor! Wait!
Hey, Eggman!
Earlier you said that this was Angel Island...
What did you mean? Explain yourself!
*sigh*[N]Such annoying pests...
It may be too much for your puny little brain to grasp, but this is Onyx Island, or Angel Island from the future!
What!? The future!?
Just like I thought... A bit too much for your little brains to comprehend.
Enough of this small talk! Time to take care of both of you!
Dang it! He got away again! If there's one thing he's good at, it's running.
But what did he mean, though? How is this place Angel Island from the future?
And what does it all have to do with the Master Emerald disappearing? Arrgh!
Gah, it just doesn't make any sense! I've just got to track Eggman down again and force him to tell the truth!
Huh?[N]Sonic? Is that you?[N]And Tails, too?
Yo, Knuckles![N] Did you decide to give up on your little quest to track down the Master Emerald?
Grr... You better shut your mouth!
I'm not letting you make a fool of me again! Let's go, Sonic!
Ho ho ho ho!
I have nothing more to say to you! Go play with Metal Sonic now!
Enough of this, Eggman! You'd better start explaining what's going on!
Fine! If you want to know so badly, I'll tell you!
I turned the Master Emerald into a card using my camera by taking a picture of it from the future Angel Island.
Since the Master Emerald is a unique object that exists across the time-space continuum...
When the future emerald was turned into a card, its existence in all the time frames vanished as well.
So that's why the Master Emerald disappeared from right in front of me!
So you finally understand.
Using the power of the Emerald, I brought all of Angel Island here, into this time frame.
So I see...all this is your fault!
How do you like that?
Don't think you've won yet! Let's see how you do against both me and Metal Sonic!
One challenger or two, it doesn't make a difference to me!
All right then... Now let's teach that Eggman a lesson!
Unforgivable! You've just made me very very angry!
Fine then! I'll use this camera to turn the whole planet into a card!
Ho ho ho ho! You can just sit back and watch! Farewell!
No! I'm too late!
That little... He just doesn't want to admit he lost!
Hey! Knuckles![N]We can't give up yet!
Sonic, Knuckles, get in! We can still catch up to him in my new Tornado plane!
All right! Let's go, Sonic!
Let's pull together on this one, Knuckles!
Let's do this together, Knuckles!
Thanks, Sonic!
We need to work together, for both our futures!
Let's do this, Silver!
Ah, so you made it this far, Knuckles. Too bad you're too late!
What!?
I've already loaded the camera onto the rocket. Now I'll be able to turn the whole earth into a card!
I just need to set this final card, and your puny little island will join my perfect collection, as well!
That card... It's the Master Emerald!
Now, then... farewell, Knuckles! Ho ho ho ho!
Hey, wait! I'll take that card back now!
All right!
I finally got the Master Emerald back!
I'll use it to send Onyx Island back where it belongs in the future.
While I'm at it, I might as well locate all the other treasures that Eggman turned into cards.
This is going to be fun!
Who's there!? You better not get in my way!
My name is Shadow... And I won't let you harm the doctor!
Ah! Shadow! Take care of him for me!
Wait! Eggman!
Hey! Wait!
Bzzz... Zzzzz... Zzzzzzz...
C-Can you hear me, Shadow? There's someone after me!
He's... Ah, it's all so confusing! I'm not sure how to explain this!
Anyway, follow this signal, and come find me! I'm counting on you, Shadow!
... Bzzzzz... Zzzz Zzp...
After that last transmission, the doctor disappeared. That was 6 hours ago. What happened to him?
Huh? What's this... A silver hedgehog?
And... He's chasing... the doctor!?
Hey you! What do you want with the doctor!?
So, was this who you were warning me about in your transmission?
Transmission? What are you talking about?
What!? 6 hours ago, you asked for my help.
Why would I ask you for your help?
What? Why are you...
Hey, wait a second. I think you may be mistaken about something...
Grr! Stop this nonsense... It's driving me crazy!
Did you see Eggman come running by there?
You let the doctor get away? Hmph! You're useless...
What'd you say!? What's your problem, Shadow!?
Don't mess with me, I'm not in the mood! I might take it out on you, got it?
Whatever Knuckles... But first, I've got some business with the doctor!
All right then... Let's see who can catch him first!
You're on! Let's do it!
The doctor's acting strange... It makes no sense, but this has nothing to do with me...
Hmm, guess this was just a waste of my time...
Bzzz... Zzzzz... Zzzzz...
This is Rouge! Can you hear me, Shadow?
I've come across something quite interesting about the doctor!
I'll fill you in on the details later. Just keep tailing him for now!
... Bzzz... Bzzzzzzp...
How is Rouge involved? What's going on with the doctor?
Hey, Shadow!
Doctor! What are you hiding?
What secret was Rouge talking about?
Rouge? Secret? What are you talking about?
Hey, my business comes first! Who cares what he's hiding.
Eggman! You'd better hand over the Master Emerald this time!
Annoying pests! I'll crush you with my mechanical pets!
Bzzz... Zzzzz... Bzzzzz...
!?
Shadow! Come in! You'll never guess what I found out!
This light!? What's going on!?
Eggman is really...
Looks like we transported to a completely different location...
Aaaaah!
Sonic! What are you doing here? And where's the doctor?
Rouge! What happened!?
Hey, look it's Shadow! Now I get it, he must be like you're looking for Eggman, too.
... Bzzz... Bzzzzzp...
It must be another race to see who can catch him first!
The transmission was cut off... What's going on?
Let's do it!
Then, why don't you test your mettle against my very own Metal Sonic, here?
Why don't you show me just how unlike Sonic you really are, then?Hoh ho ho ho!
Hmph! There's no way I'm losing to some android fake. I accept your challenge!
Doctor! I think it's time you explained yourself!
And do you know where Rouge is?
Ho ho ho ho! Were you looking for this?
Hmph! I have no time for card games!
Ah, but what if your "friend" were trapped inside this card, eh? Is this still a game to you?
W, what!?
This little troublemaker has learned too much for her own good, so I've trapped her in this card.
I'll figure out what's going on later... Now, hand over that card!
Ho ho ho! Do you really want it that badly?
It seems Rouge discovered the doctor's secret and got turned into a card...
I'll have to find the doctor and find out what the secret is...
Hey, Shadow! Did you find Eggman?
Heh... Looks like the doctor got away from you again...
Shut up! I was this close to catching him!
Anyway, doesn't seem like you've found him either!
Maybe so, but at least I'm not as clueless as you. I'll see you later!
Hey, wait! There's no way you're gonna beat me to him!
Wait! Doctor!
Tell me the secret you've been hiding. Now!
Ho ho ho ho!
Perhaps you're talking about this card?
That's...!? The doctor's on that card!
Hey, Eggman!
What's going on here!? You better start explaining!
Enough of this small talk! Time to take care of both of you!
What?! Eggman's been turned into a card, too?
Hoh ho ho! Are the two of you having fun?
Doctor!
Good timing. I can hear everything I want straight from the Doctor himself!
Sorry, but he's my target! I can't let you through!
The Doctor's been turned into a card, too, just like Rouge...?
But how would the Doctor have a card of himself? It doesn't make any sense...
Hm? It's that silver hedgehog from before!
This all started when he showed up. He's got to know something about what this is all about!
Hey, you! Why don't you tell me why you're trailing the Doctor, hmm?
You... You're Shadow!
Listen, you don't understand what's going on. Please, take this as a warning.
The man that you refer to as 'Doctor'... There's a chance that he's not the real Eggman.
What? So, then, the REAL Eggman is the one who's been turned into that card?
Heh heh heh... Now that I've told you the truth ...I'll have to dispose of you! Let's see how you do against Metal Sonic!
Metal Sonic has been programmed with all your moves and attack patterns from your last encounter, and now, he will prove to be an admirable adversary for you.
Whatever! Now, why don't I show that fake why they call me the Ultimate life form!
Who are you!?
If what you said is true, then the real doctor is trapped inside that card!
Heh heh heh...It seems it's time that we stop playing this childish game any longer...
You are quite right... I am not Eggman!
My name is Eggman NEGA!
Eggman NEGA!? But you look like...
Just like Eggman?
Of course I do! For I am a descendant of Eggman!
What!? His descendant!?
What's the matter? Nowhere left to run?
Heh heh heh... I cannot lose! If I lose now, I won't be able to change the future.
What!? Change the future? Is that what you've been trying to do?
Hmm... I won't let you get away with that!
Very well then. It looks like I'll have to put you down myself!
That's right! I'm the real Dr. Eggman!
Back in the flesh, thanks to you, Shadow!
So it looks like we have a common enemy. Want to come along?
Hmph! Is that a question?!
Very well!
Then off we go, out into space! Hang on!
Now you've done it! You've made me very very angry!
Now, I'll use this camera to transform the whole planet into a card!
Wait! Eggman NEGA!
Heh heh heh... There's nothing you can do... Goodbye!
No! I'm too late!
It's like you said before. He was only impersonating the Doctor.
It looks like you've realized who the true enemy is, Shadow.
Ho ho ho ho! It looks like you have a problem!
Wha-!? Doctor!
For now, I'll help you protect the future!
Hmph, do what you want.
About time you showed, Shadow! I'll give you a hand too!
Sonic!? Heh, just stay outta my way.
Just relax, and enjoy the moment... For it will be your last! Now, if you'll just excuse me... Heh heh heh...
Not so fast, Eggman NEGA! That card's mine!
This must be the center of the base...
Hmm? Isn't that an escape rocket!? He's going to use that to turn the entire planet into a card!
It took you long enough to get here, Shadow...
You! Why are you trying to change the future?
Heh heh heh... I'm here to change my destiny!
I come from a long line of brilliant, scientists, but that lineage was disrupted with Dr. Eggman's failures!
As a result, I have been denied my destiny as the world has refused to recognize my brilliance!
So by removing Dr. Eggman's life and failed attempts at success, I will alter our family history forever!
Now enough of this chit-chat. Once I set Rouge's card into the rocket, it's all over!
Hey, wait a minute! Come on, Shadow!
Thanks for saving me, Shadow!
That was a bit too close for comfort. What were you thinking!?
Hmph... There's no way I'd lose to someone like him who blames their own failures on the past.
That's my Shadow!
Hey, why not take a peek into our own future?
Hmph. I'll pass.
Oh, come on, Shadow. At the very least, we'd be able to do some treasure hunting together.
We can start with the other cards Eggman had!
Do what you like...
Ho ho ho ho!
You've come all this way to find me... This must be something very important!
Hey, Eggman! I've got something to ask you, about someone I'm looking for!
You! What do you want with the doctor!?
Who's there!? You better not get in my way!
My name is Shadow... And I won't let you harm the doctor!
Ah, Shadow! Take care of him for me!
Wait! Eggman!
Hey! Wait!
So, this is who you were warning me about in your transmission?
Hey, wait a second. I think you might be wrong here.
I'm just here to ask him about someone named "Eggman NEGA."
Who!? Eggman NEGA!? I have no clue who you're talking about!
Grr! Stop this nonsense... It's driving me crazy!
Eggman! I know you know something about that guy!
Ho ho ho ho! If you really need to know, I'll tell you...
But only if you can defeat that blue hedgehog!
Hey, get back here, Eggman!
Get out of my way, I've got some personal business with him.
Hey! You sure have an attitude. Who are you, anyway?
My name is Silver...
I can't tell you why, but I need to get to him before you.
Okay, Silver. Bring it on... I like challenges!
Okay! Now hand over those cards!
Grrrrr...
Hey! Move aside. I already told you I need to talk to him first.
Yo Silver... You're starting to get on my nerves!
Enough of this chit chat... Prepare yourself!
You little... Get back here!
He certainly knows how to run, I'll give him that...
Hey, you there! Did you see that guy carrying something strange?
Actually... He has this weird camera that changes things into cards... Wait a minute... Who are you?
What'd you say!? How did he get a hold of it?
You...! What are you mumbling about?
Got no time to explain it to someone like you... See ya!
"Someone like me?" Hey, I'm Knuckles! Haven't you heard of me?
How rude! Asking questions without having the gall to introduce himself!
Like I said before, I don't have time to deal with you right now. See ya!
Eggman! That camera technology shouldn't exist in this time! How did you get it?
Well, well... Seems like you're quite perceptive...
Allow me to explain...[N] If you can win a race against my dear Metal Sonic, that is!
Hmph! That outdated machine doesn't stand a chance against me!
I accept your challenge!
It appears that Eggman knows what that camera can do...
So my question is, how did he get his hands on it?
Hey, Silver! So we meet again?
Sonic!?
Heh! While you've been wasting your time, I've been figuring his next move...
What!?
If you can keep up, I might tell you what I know! Let's go!
Hey, Eggman! Things are finally starting to make sense...
"Eggman NEGA," who I'm looking for, would never let his camera out of his sight.
So, that means... You must be Eggman NEGA!
Well now... That's an interesting theory... But do you have any proof?
Hey, Eggman! Are we done with your little game yet?
Hmm... I suppose I have enough data to proceed with my plans...
But if I defeat you now, there won't be anyone left to get in my way in the present, or in the future...
The future!? You've given yourself away!
Heh! That's a big IF, Eggman. Get ready!
Dang![N]I knew that the accident with the camera...
Hoh ho ho! Are you two having fun?
Eggman?!
This ends now! I'm going to expose you for who you really are, no matter what it takes!
No! The Doctor's mine! Stay out of my way!
I can't be sure, but there's something about his speech and his mannerisms...
No, it has to be! He's got to be Eggman NEGA!
But, if that's the case, then where is the REAL Eggman?
So, we meet again. Why don't you tell me why you're trailing the Doctor, hmm?
You... You're Shadow!
Listen, you don't understand what's going on. Please, take this as a warning.
The man that you refer to as 'Doctor'... There's a chance that he's not the real Eggman.
What? So, then, the REAL Eggman is the one who's been turned into that card?
What?![N]Eggman's been turned into a card, too?
Why not give yourself up? There's no doubt in my mind that you're Eggman NEGA!
Heh heh heh... If you know that much, then the reason you're here is...
That's right! I came from the future to bring you back!
I can't allow you to abuse the camera's power!
I admire your determination, but I'm afraid I can't allow you to capture me!
I'll let Metal Sonic play with you in order to buy me the time I need to quietly sneak away.
Oh, and you'll find that Metal Sonic is a tad bit more of a capable opponent than before. Heh heh heh...
Eggman NEGA! I'm not letting you get away!
All right, Eggman NEGA! You're coming back to the future with me! You've been here far too long!
I won't let you interfere with my plan! It's time to get down to business!
So it looks like we have a common enemy. Want to come along?
Hmph! Is that a question?!
Very well!
Then off we go, out into space! Hang on!
Now you've done it... You've made me very, very angry!
I'll use this camera to turn this entire planet into a card!
Heh heh heh... There's nothing you can do, so goodbye!
No! I'm too late!
It's like you said before. He was only impersonating the Doctor.
It looks like you've realized who the true enemy is, Shadow.
Ho ho ho ho! It looks like you have a problem!
You!?
Don't be rash! I'm the real Dr. Eggman!
That man who was impersonating the Doctor... I can't allow his plans to succeed. Let me help you!
Thanks, Shadow!
Hey! It's not wise to tackle everything on your own! Let me help!
Thanks!
Eggman NEGA! This is the end of the line for you!
Ohohoh! I'm impressed that you managed to make it this far. Unfortunately, you're too late!
Liar! You're bluffing!
All I have to do is transfer the energy to the camera on my rocket, and I'll turn this whole planet into a card!
What!? That means my future would be destroyed as well!
If I can't change the future, I'll simply destroy it!
There's nobody who can stop me now! Farewell.
You're not getting away with this, Eggman NEGA! I won't let you ruin the future!
Eggman NEGA... It looks like he lost control of his machine, and got turned into a card himself...
As soon as I can collect the other cards, and take care of Eggman NEGA's mess, I'll head back to the future...
This time frame will be fine, so long as they're around...
Those blue and black hedgehogs certainly are brave...
Ho ho ho ho!
Wait! Come back here!
No hard feelings, Sonic, but this time there's no way you're gonna beat me!
Okay, Knuckles... Then let's race for it! First one who gets to Eggman takes all!
Ho ho ho ho![N]It's been a while, hasn't it, Sonic?
Hey, Eggman![N]What have you done with Amy and Tails!?
Not to worry, they're sound asleep inside these cards.
Hey, Eggman!
The Master Emerald is gone...[N]I'll bet you're behind this, aren't you?!
Heh heh heh... Yes, that's right!
This camera lets me turn anything into a card...
And I'll use it to create the ultimate card collection!
If either of you want these cards, you'll need to catch me first!
All right, Eggman![N]Hand over those cards!
Hmm... I suppose if you win my little contest, I could give you a card of your choosing.
What!?[N]That's not what you said before!
Heh! Pretty much what I expected from you, Eggman. Okay, bring it on!
Grr! I'll get you, Sonic!
Hey, get back here, Eggman!
Get out of my way, I've got some personal business to take care of.
Hey! You sure have an attitude.[N]Who are you, anyway?
My name is Silver...
I can't tell you why, but I need to get to him before you.
Okay, Silver.[N]Bring it on... I like challenges!
Okay! Now hand over those cards!
Grrrrr...
Hey! Move aside. I already told you I need to talk to him first.
Yo Silver... you're starting to get on my nerves!
Enough of this chit chat...[N]Prepare yourself!
It's too dangerous to get close to him! Hyah!
Where am I!?
Hey, what're you doing!?[N]Wha-!
Looks like we've been transported to a completely different location...
Sonic! What are you doing here? And where's the doctor?
Hey, look it's Shadow!? Now I get it, he must be looking for Eggman, too.
It must be another race to see who can catch him first!
Let's do it!
Heh. Looks like I've left Shadow clear in the dust. Guess he's really not as fast as he thinks.
Hoh ho ho ho![N]That was a thrilling little contest there, Sonic!
Eggman![N]What are you up to this time?
Heh heh heh...[N]You must be proud of yourself, having beaten Shadow so handily.
How do you feel about trying out your skills against my lovely Metal Sonic?
Wh-what?[N]Metal Sonic?!
Come forth, Metal Sonic![N]Show this pathetic hedgehog what you're capable of!
Now, Sonic, let's see if you really are the fastest thing in the world, shall we?
Hoh ho ho ho!
Eggman said something about the strongest and the fastest...[N]What's he up to?
Ah ha! Looks like I've caught up to him again!
Hey, Silver![N]We meet again!
Sonic!
Dang! How did he manage to get back here so quickly?
Heh! While you've been wasting your time, I've been figuring his next move...
What!?
If you can keep up, I might tell you what I know![N]Let's go!
Okay, Eggman! I've proven that I'm the fastest and the strongest!
So hand over Tails' card now!
You want this card that badly, eh?
Hmm... I suppose I have enough data...
But if I defeat you now, there won't be anyone left to get in my way in the present, or in the future...
The future!?[N]You've given yourself away!
Heh! That's only IF you can defeat me![N]Bring it on Eggman!
So you think you can track down Eggman faster than me? Let's do this!
Curse you, Sonic![N]I won't forget this!
Yes![N]I got Tails' card back!
Phew![N]Sonic, you saved me!
But be careful![N]I just know that Eggman's got some more tricks up his sleeve.
Don't worry![N]He can try whatever he wants, but there's no way he's getting away with it!
Sonic? Is that you?[N]And Tails, too?
That must mean that you got the card back from Eggman. I'm too late!
Sorry about that, Knuckles, but if you're trying to stay on Eggman's heels, you have to be quicker than that.
Grr... You better shut your mouth!
You can't run, Eggman![N]No matter where you try to hide, I'll always track you down!
Humph! Mouthing off as always... If you're so eager to finish things, why don't you let me oblige you!
Metal Sonic![N]I command you!
What, that lame robot copy of yours again? You really need to get ahold of some better toys, you know.
Heh heh heh... The previous Metal Sonic was able to capture data from your last match... Data I was able to recover!
I've already updated this new model with that data so that it'll be wise to your little tricks.
This time, it's YOU who's going to get sent to the junk yard, Sonic!
A copy is still just a copy! It'll never be able to top the original!
Grr! Enough of this already!
Let's see how you fare against both me and Metal Sonic!
Makes no difference to me![N]Let's go!
Unforgivable! You've just made me very very angry!
Fine then! I'll use this camera to turn the whole planet into a card!
Are you running away again, Eggman!?[N]Get back here and fight!
Ho ho ho ho! You can just sit back and watch! Farewell!
Dang it! I'm too late!
Sonic, Knuckles, get in! We can still catch up to him in my new Tornado plane!
Great timing, Tails!
Let's pull together on this one, Knuckles!
All right then... Now let's teach that Eggman a lesson!
I'll give you a hand, Sonic![N]Let's take care of him together!
Thanks, Knuckles!
I need to find the truth![N]I'll help you, Sonic!
Then let's do this, Shadow!
Look, Sonic!
Eggman's trying to escape in that rocket with the giant camera on it!
You're too late, Sonic! I've already gathered enough energy to take a picture of the entire planet!
Once I put this final card through my energy transfer device, the world will be mine!
Nice knowing you, Sonic![N]Hoh ho ho ho!
That's Amy's card![N]I totally forgot about her!
We have to hurry before he converts Amy's card into energy!
Then we gotta hurry![N]You're not getting away, Eggman!
That's terrible! We've got to find those cards right now!
You heard him, right Amy? I've got to run! See ya!
Hey! Wait, Sonic!
Where... where am I?
Are you okay, Amy?
Eggman used his camera to turn us into cards...
But Sonic saved us!
Wow! Sonic![N]You fought to save me!?
You're my knight in shining armor, Sonic!
So that means we're going to live happily ever after!
Um... Uh, Tails... Didn't Eggman have other cards with him when he split?
Y-Yeah... There might be some others trapped in the cards that need rescuing...
